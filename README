This project contains my coding conventions for JavaScript.

It is heavily inspired on the work of Douglas Crockford (http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html).

I've added examples and notes about objects and unit testing.

The project also contains a test suite that documents some of the trickier bits of JavaScript.
